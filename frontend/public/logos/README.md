# Partner Logos

This directory contains SVG logos for partners displayed on the homepage.

You should add the following logo files here:

- google.svg
- amazon.svg
- microsoft.svg
- apple.svg
- tesla.svg
- meta.svg

These should be grayscale SVG files for best visual appearance as they will be displayed in grayscale with a hover effect to show full color.

## How to get these logos:

1. You can create simplified versions or use official brand logos with appropriate permissions
2. Ensure logos are optimized SVGs for fast loading
3. Make sure they have similar dimensions for consistent display
4. Consider using a service like Simple Icons (https://simpleicons.org/) for brand icons
